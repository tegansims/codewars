# Christmas Tree

Create a function christmasTree(height) or christmas_tree(height) (in Ruby) that returns a christmas tree of the correct height

```christmasTree(5)``` should return:

        *    
       ***   
      *****  
     ******* 
    *********
Height passed is always an integer between 0 and 100.

Use ```\n``` for newlines between each line.

Pad with spaces so each line is the same length. The last line having only stars, no spaces.
